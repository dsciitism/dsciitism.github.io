Inspired by the likes of magnanimous research oriented institutes/labs in our country, the Data Science Club is a far-sighted initiative by  Mr. Rajat Gupta (Batch 2018), Mr. Ashwani Choudhary (Batch 2018), and Mr. Parardha Kumar(Batch 2019) to emphasize the research aspects of various domains of Data Science. The main goal of the club is not just to limit the working for projects but to contribute to the research community devoted to artificial intelligence, data analytics, and cross-domain applications.

Starting as a small peer group consisting of interested Data Science enthusiasts, the club grew both in its extent and capacity to incorporate more like-minded , research oriented students of IIT ISM Dhanbad within itself. One of the main reasons behind the establishment of this club was to provide ample opportunity of research to the students of IIT ISM.
